## A New Post

Which is a bit like A New Hope, only with more blog-ness.

So this would be my first post here. It's being written with [Prose](https://prose.io), which is pretty good for a browser basededitor. Things which need tweaking so far - the autocorrect is disabled, including automatic caps off after an initial letter, automatic apostrophes and so on. Surprisngly good though.

Right, back to [the guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) then.
